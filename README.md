# Backend developer coding task "Social tournament service"
As a gaming website we want to implement a tournament service with a feature called "Back a friend".
Each player holds certain amount of bonus points. Website funds its players with bonus points based on all kind of activity. Bonus points can traded to goods and represent value like real money.
One of the social products class is a social tournament. This is a competition between players in a multi-player game like poker, bingo, etc)
Entering a tournament requires a player to deposit certain amount of entry fee in bonus points. If a player has not enough point he can ask other players to back him and get a part the prize in case of a win.
In case of multiple backers, they submit equal part of the deposit and share the winning money in the same ration.
